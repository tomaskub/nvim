# This is my neovim config
I mostly use this to get setup on new machine and keep all of the options i have the same across different machines. Makes it easier to go around, especially when you have to implement the same change on 3 machines.

# Usage 
Clone the repository to the .config file, change directory name if you want to use it with different alias. 

``` bash 
git clone git@github.com:tomaskub/nvim
```
